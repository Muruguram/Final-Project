Project Title: NLP Project with Streamlit App

Description:
This project is an NLP-based application built using Python, NLTK, and Streamlit. The app helps in classifying data with a target variable `has_converted` for e-commerce conversion prediction. It features a user-friendly interface to upload datasets and visualize the results, all powered by Streamlit.

Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess your input data with natural language processing techniques using NLTK.
- E-commerce Conversion Prediction: A machine learning model to predict if a user has converted or not based on the dataset.
- Streamlit Interface: A web interface to upload files, visualize results, and make predictions.
- Dynamic Tabs: Tabs for different sections of the project, including E-commerce Conversion and NLP Data Exploration.

Tech Stack:
- Python: Programming language used for the project.
- NLTK: Library for natural language processing.
- Streamlit: Framework for creating the web interface.
- Scikit-learn: Library used for building the machine learning model.


4. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run main.py

How to Use:
1. Upload Data: The **E-commerce Conversion** tab contains a file uploader. Upload your dataset in CSV format for analysis.
2. Data Exploration: Use the **NLP Data Exploration** tab for insights into the dataset, including word frequency analysis.
